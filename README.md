# CovarianceDenoising
This project implements the covariance matrix denoising process provided in Marcos M. López de Prado's "Machine Learning for Asset Managers" (2020), Section 2, and visualizes the results in a similar fashion as in the text. Instead of using simulated data, I fetch data for a portfolio of 30 companies using the yfinance API. The portfolio represents a random sample of companies. The portfolio implemented in the sample is not an investment reccomendation, and is simply for expository purposes.
